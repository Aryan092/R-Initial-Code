2. Mathematical questions

For each problem below include your code in the report as well as answering the questions posed.

(a) Function returns the squares of each number in non-decreasing order.

(b) Function returns only the odd values in the original list.

(c)(i) What does min() and sort() functions do?

(c)(i) Own min(x) function.

(c)(ii) Own sort(x, decreasing = FALSE) function.

(d) Function return.prime() which determines if input natural number is a prime or not. below 1000 there are. How many are there?

3. Simple random walk

(a) Generate (D1,...,D1000) where the Dis are as described above and store this sequence in the vector D.

(b) Use the command cumsum() to generate (X0,X1,...,X1000) and store this sequence in the vector X.

(c) Plot your random walk.
